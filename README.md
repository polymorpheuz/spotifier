#Spotifier

The repo with source code of the [Telegram bot for handling Spotify updates](https://t.me/spotifierbot).

##TBD
- Account market functionality. The problem is that for different markets, releases can be different. Usually it's not the case but difference between release for Australia+New Zealand and the rest of the world is real. And there won't be any additional updates so it should be fixed.
- Handle scan operation cursor return because updates will quickly get out of hand.
- Substitute `/list' command to something else because sometimes it works in a strange way and I have a suspicion that it's some kind of a reserved word.
